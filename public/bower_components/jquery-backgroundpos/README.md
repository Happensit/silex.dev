jQuery Background Position
==========================

This plugin allows the position of a background image to be animated.

* Specify positions by name or pixel location.
* Apply standard speed and easing settings.

Have a look at the plugin Web site, http://keith-wood.name/backgroundPos.html, for demonstrations of its abilities.

For documentation on the functionality see http://keith-wood.name/backgroundPosRef.html.
